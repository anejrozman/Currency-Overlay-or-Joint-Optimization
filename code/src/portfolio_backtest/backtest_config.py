# The mean-bearing versions were kept just long enough to record why. At gamma = 3:
#   * the asset program collapses onto 19 of 101 names at the leverage bound
#     (results/runs/reg_mv_asset_zero/run_1)
#   * the overlay reaches a gross psi of up to 98x the portfolio notional
#     (results/runs/reg_mv_curr_overlay/run_1)
#   * the joint program reaches up to 74x, with 6-131 active assets
